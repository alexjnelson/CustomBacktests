# CustomBacktests
This module serves as a framework to backtest custom trading strategies on data gathered from the yfinance library, or another time-stamped dataframe. It
also provides functionality for many common technical indicators, including moving averages, RSI, Bollinger bands, and candlestick patterns. For sample
usage, check out the sample_run and backtesting/sample_backtests python files.
